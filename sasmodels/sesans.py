    Compute the expected SESANS polarization for a given SANS pattern.

    come from the dataset.  $q$ should be chosen such that the oscillations
    in $I(q)$ are well sampled (e.g., $5 \cdot 2 \pi/d_{\max}$).

    *SElength* [A] is the set of $z$ points at which to compute the
    Hankel transform

    *wavelength* [m]  is the wavelength of each individual point *zz*

    *thickness* [cm] is the sample thickness.

    *q* [A$^{-1}$] is the set of $q$ points at which the model has been
    computed. These should be equally spaced.

    *I* [cm$^{-1}$] is the value of the SANS model at *q*
